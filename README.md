All code here is written and run in Stata BE (Basic Edition). It is recommended to use the Do-file Editor in Stata for executing the scripts.

## How to Run

**Step 1:**
Download the Week 1 Assignment folder. Make sure to store all data sets as named in the repository.

**Step 2:**
Set the folder the data is stored in as Working Directory. Note that all Stata scripts must be created in the same Working Directory.

**Step 3:**
Download the cleaning_and_merging.do file, and open it in Stata. Set the Working Directory as on your machine, and run the script to get cleaned and merged data sets.

**Step 4:**
Download the desc_stats_and_visualisation.do file, and open it in Stata. Set the Working Directory as on your machine, and run the script to get the summary statistics and graphs.
